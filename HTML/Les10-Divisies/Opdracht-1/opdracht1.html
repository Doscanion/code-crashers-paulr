        Starter Pokémon, or Starters, are the Pokémon a trainer chooses at the
        beginning of their Pokémon journey. In each generation of Pokémon games,
        a set of Starter Pokémon are available for new trainers to choose from
        in sets of three; the types that make up these sets are Fire, Grass, and
        Water.
